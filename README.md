![Design preview for the Manage landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the [Manage landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 



## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
